### Hi, I'm Hayden. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Developer working at RBC currently working within the payments space. Outside of work, I keep myself busy building [small utility scripts](https://github.com/HaydenMeloche/thermostat-scheduler), contributing to [open source projects](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/pull/1902) and maintaining one of the [largest mods available for Rocket League](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/108).

```kotlin
val me = Developer().apply {
    name = "Hayden Meloche"
    speaks = arrayOf("Java", "Kotlin", "Typescript", "Python", "Javascript")
    usesDaily = arrayOf("Git", "GitHub", "Spring Boot", "Maven", "NPM", "OpenApi Spec", "Docker", "Mockito")
    experienceIn = arrayOf("building scaleable systems", "microservices", "public speaking", "devops", "CI/CD", "agile development", "advanced design patterns")
    interests = arrayOf("tech", "basketball", "collecting watches", "ben and jerry's")
}
