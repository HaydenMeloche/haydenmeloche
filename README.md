### Hi, I'm Hayden. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Founding Engineer @ [Pine](http://pine.ca) building the future of Canadian mortgage lending. Outside of work, I keep myself busy building [small utility scripts](https://github.com/HaydenMeloche/thermostat-scheduler), contributing to [open source projects](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/pull/1902) and maintaining one of the [largest mods available for Rocket League](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/108).
